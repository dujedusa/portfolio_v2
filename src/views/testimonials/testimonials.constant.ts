        "It's my pleasure to recommend our former employee Duje Duša for the
        software developer job position. He is cordial and fits easily into
        the team. He quickly acquired the necessary professional knowledge,
        showing additional initiative and successfully solving all the given
        problems. He performed his work tasks correctly and on time, both in
        the company office and while working from home due to the COVID-19
        pandemic. He has made visible professional progress and I believe he
        can be a valuable member of your team."
