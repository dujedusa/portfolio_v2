    My journey as an Software Developer began in 2014. with the slightest
    touches with the C/C++ programming language and writing primitive
    console applications. Since then, within college project, I've built
    simple Music Player which represents first real encounters with real
    life applications. I've earned Master of Science degree at Faculty of
    Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture
    within which I developed hybrid mobile application using Web
    Technologies. To this day, I've worked at Infomedica, medical-IT

    Besides being a Software Developer Lecturer in 2019. at Jantar -
    Foreign Language School, which drastically improved my presentation
    and teaching skills, I've also been volunteering as a Stage
    Technician/Live Sound Engineer in local night club Kocka. Although
    it's not software development oriented, volunteering gave me wide
    range of skills like teamwork and collaboration with other event
    organization departments and/or artists, coordination and management
    of technical operations, solving complex problems etc. Also, I'm a
    passionate drummer that enjoys listening and exploring music. ü•Å ‚ô´ üéß
